Getting Started
===============

The preferred method of downloading and installing EasyRdf, is to use
[Composer], a dependency manager that tracks all dependencies of your project.


First, install composer in your project:

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php


Create a composer.json file in your project root:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "easyrdf/easyrdf": "*"
    }
}
```

Install EasyRdf (and any other dependencies) using:

    php composer.phar install


Then to start using EasyRdf in your project, add this to the top of your file:

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

This will load composer's autoloader and make the EasyRdf classes available to your
programme.


A full basic example looks like this:

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$foaf = new \EasyRdf\Graph("http://njh.me/foaf.rdf");
$foaf->load();
$me = $foaf->primaryTopic();
echo "My name is: ".$me->get('foaf:name')."\n";
```
