# Contributing

Contributions to the codebase and documentation are welcome using the usual Github pull request workflow.

More details for developers are in [DEVELOPER.md](https://github.com/easyrdf/easyrdf/blob/main/DEVELOPER.md).

## Important notes

* Please create an [issue](https://github.com/easyrdf/easyrdf/issues) before starting work on any significant changes
* We only accept code bundled with tests, no matter if its a new feature or bug fix. It strengthened the codebase and avoids regressions later on.
